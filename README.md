## About me
I developed an interest in computers after playing Super Mario World for the
GameBoy Advance. As a four-year-old I was enraptured by how an entire world
appeared before me in a small handheld device. Initially, my motivation was
to become a video game developer, but in the process of pursuing that goal,
I found that I was more fascinated by the inner workings of the computer
systems on which video games run than the video games themeselves. This
fascination led me to pursue a degree in computer engineering, foucsing on
computer systems and low-level software.

Currently, I am a working as an embedded software developer specializing in
systems programming. I maintain an Arch-Linux-based operating systems for
embedded ARM systems. I work on a wide variety of software including firmmware
and bare-metal applications, bootloaders, kernel and userspace drivers, and the
Linux kernel.
