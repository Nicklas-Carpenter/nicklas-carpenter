## About me
I developed an interest in computers after playing Super Mario World: Super
Mario Advance 2 for the GameBoy Advance. As a four-year-old I was enraptured by
how an entire world appeared before me in a small handheld device. I knew right
then and there that I wanted to be a video game developer. As I grew up, I
learned that all the artistic talent in the family went to my sisters, but I
also realized that my passion was for what was going on behind the scenes.
Computer systems were always this impapable black box, and I became determined
to learn how they work.

Years passed and I am now a computer engineer working as an embedded
software developer. I found that I love working at the low level: interfacing
with hardware, working with operating systems, and dabbling in compilers. At my
job I get to hack around with Linux, U-Boot, and occasionally some bare-metal
applications, and I wouldn't have it any other way. When I am not at work, I
like to do a lot of the same thing at home as side projects. I also enjoy
expanding my horizons, like studying topics in math and other subjects I'm
interested in but didn't have the time to pursue in school.

I have non-engineering related hobbies too. I enjoy cooking, reading a
good book,and working on writing projects with my wife.
